## Request Form

Please fill out the form to provide more details about your documentation deliverable. It will make it easier for us to process your request. 

> Use `x` in the checkboxes if the choice is true for you, for example, "`[x] SAP BTP`".

### To what area does your documentation contribute to?

* [ ] SAP BTP
* [ ] Other:
```
<Enter your area here>
```
### In what system do you write documentation for your deliverable (_documentation source_)?

* [ ] SAP DITA CCMS
* [ ] GitHub (github.tools.sap or github.wdf.sap.corp)

> If your documentation source is GitHub, we cannot offer any support for coDoc.

### What target groups do you have in mind?

* [ ] Developers
* [ ] Administrators
* [ ] Other:

```
<Specify one or more target groups not listed above>
```

> We focus on developers as target group, because it's likely that developers use GitHub already in their daily work. Previous pilots with other target groups didn't get much feedback so it's questionable if we should spend the effort for such deliverables.

### What is the number of documentation deliverables (buildable maps) that could be suitable for external collaboration through github.com:

```
<Number of deliverables>
```

### What deliverables (buildable maps) you would like to expose for external collaboration on github.com:

```
<links to productive versions on SAP Help Portal>
```

### What delivery model do you use (SAP DITA CCMS)?

* [ ] push-to-ship
* [ ] sprint-based _including_ container cloning
* [ ] sprint-based _without_ container cloning (e.g., your container stays always open)

### How many versions of your HTML deliverables do you keep on SAP Help Portal?

```
<For example, if you always overwrite one external version, put "1" here.>
```

### What are the main contacts?

Responsible manager (UA manager, PO, or Dev Manager):
```
<full name>
```
UA responsible (doc lead):
```
<full name>
```

Dev contact:
```
<full name>
```
> It's a best practice to have at least two administrators assigned to the repositories we create. For a better scale-out, we require that you have a developer in the boat as buddy of the UA for GitHub questions, and who manages together with the UA responsible the repositories. 

### Do you have any special requirements you'd like to make us aware of?

```
<usage of special DITA elements, etc.>
```

Thank you for taking the time to fill out this form.
