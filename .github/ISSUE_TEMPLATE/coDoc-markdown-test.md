# Ensure High Quality Markdown Output for Collaboration

To collaborate with customers on your documentation, you need to publish a Markdown version of your documentation in addition to the already existing HTML version on SAP Help Portal. The following prerequisites avoid confusion and ensure a smooth collaboration process:

* The Markdown version must be in sync with your HTML version.
* The quality of the Markdown output must be good enough.

This step addresses the second requirement.

1. Follow the documentation [Test your Markdown Output](https://github.tools.sap/UACP/internal-guidelines/blob/main/docs/10-opensource/ditacms-is-source/sap-docs-process/test-markdown.md).
2. Comment on this issue once the tests are finished without any blockers.
