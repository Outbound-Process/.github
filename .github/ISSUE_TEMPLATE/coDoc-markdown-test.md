# Ensure High Quality Markdown Output for Collaboration

To collaborate with customers on your documentation, you need to publish a Markdown version of your documentation in addition to the already existing HTML version on SAP Help Portal. The following prerequisites avoid confusion and ensure a smooth collaboration process:

* The Markdown version must be in sync with your HTML version.
* The quality of the Markdown output must be good enough.

This step addresses the second requirement.

1. Wait until we have created a test repository for you.
   
   **Link to test repository**: tbd
   
3. Follow the documentation [Test your Markdown Output](https://help.sap.com/docs/open-documentation-initiative/uacp_internal-guidelines_uacp_internal-guidelines_docs/10-opensource_ditacms-is-source_sap-docs-process_test-markdown.html?state=DRAFT&version=internal).
4. Comment on this issue once the tests are finished without any blockers.
