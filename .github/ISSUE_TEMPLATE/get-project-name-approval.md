Create a [request for SAP Branding](https://www.sapbrandtools.com/naming-center/#/create-request) for approving your project name. Please see additional information about naming of open source projects [here](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ospodocs/Hints+and+Guidelines+for+Project+Naming).

**Normally, i.e. if you stick to the [hints and guidelines for project naming](https://wiki.wdf.sap.corp/wiki/display/ospodocs/Hints+and+Guidelines+for+Project+Naming), the approval of a name for an open source project takes a few days. The 3-5 weeks that are mentioned on the Brand Tools request form are for general name requests.**

Please document the outcome of the branding request in this issue.
