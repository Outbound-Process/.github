Dear all,

This is to request publication to OSS Store **PyPi**.


@Requestor: To be able to publish on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), it is required to have a PPMS FOSS entry for your open source project.
To get this entry, please [ask GTLC to create it for you](https://itsm.services.sap/sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5050b27a1bbe9910b0a620a6bb4bcbfe&sysparm_category=f68b2abe1b3a9910b0a620a6bb4bcb9a&catalog_id=04ce6e71db12d910034ca8ebd396199e). In case there are any delays with the PPMS FOSS entry creation, please let us know here in this issue. We will reach out via e-mail to 'DL GTLC Compliance Enablement' for follow-ups.

Once this has been done, please fill out below form:

- Product / App Name: [OFFICIAL PRODUCT NAME]

- List of Project Members: [USER_ID; USER_ID; USER_ID; ...]

- One Project Responsible (e.g. Product Owner): [USER_ID]
