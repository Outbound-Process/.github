@Requestor: Please create a comment containing a link to a GitHub repository that includes the source code that you want to publish. The GitHub repository should be hosted on [github.wdf.sap.corp](https://github.wdf.sap.corp) or [github.tools.sap](https://github.tools.sap/) and be public so that the automated code scan can read the source code.

An automated code scan will be initiated for this repository. You will receive a notification once the result is available.

Thank you!
