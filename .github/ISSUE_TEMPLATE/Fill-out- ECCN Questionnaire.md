# Export Control Classification Questionnaire for Outbound Open Source Contributions 
Uploading software to an External Repository as part of the Outbound Open Source process  is considered an export. Therefore, export control laws and regulations may apply.  
SAP checks each delivery of software (physical delivery and electronic download) against applicable EU and US export regulations. This process is critical when cryptographic code is present, implemented, used; or when the software has been developed for customers who are in the defense business or in collaboration with a military organization.
The export control classification process is mandatory to ensure that export regulations are fulfilled and all data in the determination of export regulations is collected for each mobile app. This process is necessary to ensure SAP does not violate export control regulations.
The violation of export control regulations can result not only in significant fines for SAP but also in criminal penalties for individuals responsible, especially if the submitter of a questionnaire submits incorrect information. Therefore, you should answer the following questions with care and truthfully.
The following questions have to be answered considering all parts of the outbound open source contribution, including re-used SAP components, open source, or third-party components. 

After the completion of this questionnaire, please reach out to [SAP Export Control Classification](ExportControlClassification@sap.com). The same address can also be used in case of any detailed questions regarding the process.

## ECCN Questions
###  1a) Does the application perform cryptography, or otherwise contain any parts or components that are capable of performing any information security functions?

(e.g.: encryption, decryption, key management / public key infrastructure (PKI), authentication (e.g. password protection, digital signature), copy protection, anti-virus protection)
```
(Provide your answer here)
```

###  1b) If yes, has the application been designed or modified to perform any cryptographic functions other than authentication or digital signature or the execution of copy-protected software?

(Authentication includes all aspects of access control where there is no encryption of files or text except as directly related to the protection of passwords, Personal Identification Numbers (PINs) or similar data to prevent unauthorized access.)
```

### 2. Does the product enable another item (i.e. another software or hardware) to perform Cryptography or any Information Security functions that would otherwise not be enabled?

(e.g. encryption, decryption, key management / public key infrastructure (PKI), etc.)
```

```

### 6. Is the application specially designed or modified for the generation, operation or delivery of, or communication with, "intrusion software"?

(Intrusion software means software specially designed or modified to avoid detection, or to defeat "protective countermeasures" and performing any of the following:  extraction, modification (data,path) in order to execute externally provided instructions.)
